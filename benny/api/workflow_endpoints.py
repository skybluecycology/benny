"""Workflow endpoints — the PBR-001 Phase 2 unified surface.

Three routes on top of the manifest/runner primitives already in place:

    POST /api/workflows/plan        → build + sign a manifest
    POST /api/workflows/run         → execute a signed manifest
    GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/events  → SSE stream of run lifecycle events

The *manifest* module still owns CRUD (/api/manifests/*). These endpoints
are the cross-surface contract Claude, the CLI, and the UI all target
identically — the name "workflows" signals "plan + run" as one thing.
